The x2goclient application is the client part of X2Go. It should be installed on a client computer to access an X2Go server running on another machine.

The x2goclient application provides you the possibility to access the remote running desktop, exchange files with it and redirect sound from the session on the server to your local client. x2goclient can be started via the Desktop Environment's application menu or by using the command line in a shell (simply type x2goclient there and hit enter).
